# Development

## Components

### Styles

Component styles must be developed as [(S)CSS-Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules) using SASS;
the SASS file must have the following format: `{ComponentName}.module.scss`
It's recommeded to import the shared scss files that contains the import for the Include Media util
and few mixins.

Class names should be named using pascal-case.

Example:
```scss
@import '../styles/shared';

.cardsList {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  justify-content: flex-start;
  align-items: flex-start;

  [class^="MediumCard"] {
    margin: 0 2rem 2rem 0;
  }
}
```
